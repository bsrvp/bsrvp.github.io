I am a Mathematician who is fascinated by the applications of Mathematics to real life problems. My research interests include **Theoretical Biological Control, Mathematical Bio-economics** and **Bio-geochemical modelling** of lagoon ecosystems. My research in Theoretical Biological Control involves developing mathematical models to study the predator-pest interactions in the presence of additional/alternative food to predators and controllability aspects with applications to biological pest control. My research on Bio-geochemical modelling of lagoon ecosystem focuses on developing mathematical models to study the bio-geochemical events that are responsible for the changes occurring in the oxygen, nitrogen and carbon cycles of Lake ecosystems with particular reference to Chilka Lake, India.

At present, I am an Assistant Professor (Senior) at Department of Mathematics, School of Advanced Sciences, Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India.

Before this, I was a Postdoc in the group of <span style="color: #4112ff">Prof. Santanu Ray</span> at Ecological Modelling Laboratory, Department of Zoology, Visva-Bharati University, Shantiniketan for a short period of six months.

I obtained my Doctorate Degree in Mathematics from Andhra University under the supervision of <span style="color: #4112ff">Prof. P.D.N. Srinivasu</span> in the area of Mathematical Biology on the topic “**Dynamics of additional food provided the predator-prey system with applications to biological pest control.**”
