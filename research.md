# Research

Basically, my research is classified into three main categories:

- Theoretical Biological Control
- Mathematical Bio-economics
- Bio-geochemical Modelling of Lagoon Ecosystems



## Theoretical Biological Control 

My research in Theoretical Biological Control involves developing mathematical models to study the predator-pest interactions and study the controllability aspects with applications to biological control. 

## Mathematical Bio-economics 

My research on Mathematical Bio-economics focusses on developing mathematical models to develop the control strategies and their economic aspects.

## Lagoon Ecosystem Modelling 

My research on Bio-geochemical modelling of lagoon ecosystem focuses on developing mathematical models to study the bio-geochemical events that are responsible for the changes occurring in the oxygen, nitrogen and carbon cycles of Lake ecosystems with special reference to Chilka Lake, India.
