# Personal Website of B S R V Prasad

This is my personal website. I am a mathematician working in the areas of Mathematical Biology and Mathematical Ecology. My research interests include Theoretical Biological Control, Mathematical Bio-economics and Bio-geochemical modelling of lagoon ecosystems. My research in Theoretical Biological Control involves developing mathematical models to study the predator-pest interactions in the presence of additional/alternative food to predators and controllability aspects with applications to biological pest control. My research on Bio-geochemical modelling of lagoon ecosystem focuses on developing mathematical models to study the bio-geochemical events that are responsible for the changes occurring in the oxygen, nitrogen and carbon cycles of Lake ecosystems with particular reference to Chilka Lake, India.
